# Trivy Ignore File
# This file contains CVEs that are acknowledged but cannot be immediately fixed
# These are typically in embedded Go stdlib within pre-compiled binaries

# Go stdlib vulnerabilities in Terraform, Terragrunt, TFLint, TFSec, Trivy, eksctl
# These require upstream projects to rebuild with newer Go versions
# Tracking issues:
# - Terraform: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases
# - Terragrunt: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases
# - TFLint: https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/releases
